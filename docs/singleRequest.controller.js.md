# singleRequest.controller.js

## Overview
This controller manages the logic for handling single eClaim requests, including submission, validation, locking, and workflow routing for different user roles (claimant, claim assistant, verifier, approver, etc.). It coordinates the mass upload process, claim item validation, and workflow transitions, integrating with multiple repositories and utility modules.

## Main Functions
- **postClaims(request):**
  - Main entry point for submitting claims. Determines user role and routes the request to the appropriate workflow handler (claimant, CA, verifier, approver, etc.).
- **populateStartTimeEndTime(massUploadRequest):**
  - Ensures claim items have default start and end times if not provided.
- **claimantSubmissionFlow(massUploadRequest, roleFlow, loggedInUserDetails):**
  - Handles the submission flow for claimants, including validation, saving, locking, and email notifications.
- **fetchRequestLockedUser(draftId):**
  - Checks if a request is locked and by whom.
- **checkIsLocked(loggedInUserDetails, fetchRequestLockedByUser):**
  - Validates if the current user is allowed to access a locked request.
- **claimantCASaveSubmit(...)**
  - Handles saving and submitting claims for claimants and claim assistants.

## Key Logic and Data Flow
- Determines user role and routes requests accordingly.
- Validates and processes claim data, including draft handling and workflow transitions.
- Manages request locking to prevent concurrent edits.
- Integrates with email service for notifications.
- Handles error states and validation results for each claim item.

## Notable Dependencies
- Repositories: `util.repo`, `eclaimsData.repo`, `requestLockDetails.repo`, `processParticipant.repo`, `eligibilityCriteria.repo`, `dateToWeek.repo`, `eclaimsItemData.repo`, `processDetails.repo`, `taskDetails.repo`, `chrsJobInfo.repo`
- Utilities: `commonUtil`, `dateUtil`, `constant`, `customErrors`, `eclaimService`, `validationResultsDto`, `rateTypeConfig`
- SAP CAP: `@sap/cds`

## Error Handling
- Uses custom exceptions and error codes for workflow and validation errors.
- Returns CAP-compliant error responses for locked requests, invalid data, and workflow issues.

## Exports
- Multiple workflow and claim-related functions, with `postClaims` as the main entry point.
